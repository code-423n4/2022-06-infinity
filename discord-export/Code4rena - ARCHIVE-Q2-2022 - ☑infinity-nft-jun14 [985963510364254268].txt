Hello @nneverlander 
Nice to meet you.
Let me confirm one thing.
So the scope of the contest contains 4 .sol files?

I see rsvp said this contest has 2 files only before.

[06/14/2022 8:30 PM] nneverlander
hey yo - yea 4 .sol files - but the InfinityToken.sol is a pretty standard ERC20 contract so effectively 3 .sol files


[06/14/2022 8:30 PM] nneverlander
InfinityExchange.sol, InfinityOrderBookComplication.sol and InfinityStaking.sol


[06/14/2022 8:32 PM] hansfriese
I got it. Thanks for your answer.


[06/14/2022 8:39 PM] 100proof
@nneverlander Could you explain what sniping is?


[06/14/2022 8:41 PM] nneverlander
Sniping simply means buying an NFT as soon as it is listed; its just a term used by degen traders

some tests are failing in the repo:
```
  217 passing (3m)
  22 failing
```
does everyone get this too?

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[06/15/2022 5:22 AM] chatch
ah so failures occuring with `hardhat test` but all tests passing with `runTests.sh` so that's fine. i'll run the tests with that script or individually.

I’m a bit unfamiliar with vyper. What’s the rationale behind eventually porting these over to vyper?

[06/16/2022 12:02 AM] 0xdjango
Probably a dense question, but how does a user actually create a buy or sell order? I'm only seeing functions to match orders and cancel existing.


[06/16/2022 2:26 AM] nneverlander
Creating orders is an off chain action


[06/16/2022 2:26 AM] nneverlander
You can see the test cases for some examples

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[06/16/2022 3:39 PM] izhuer
Hi, may I know how the off-chain mechanism works? Taking `matchOneToManyOrders` as an example, when a user propose an order, will the `MATCH_EXECUTOR` automatically group orders as `manyMakerOrders` ? or the user needs to specify a group of orders as `manyMakerOrders` and let `MATCH_EXECUTOR` know?


[06/16/2022 3:40 PM] izhuer
Is there any doc about the algorithm used by `MATCH_EXECUTOR`, lol 😂


[06/16/2022 7:11 PM] nneverlander
no this code is not public


[06/16/2022 7:11 PM] nneverlander
yes the executor will group orders automatically

an off-topic question about how the award pool would be distributed? Sorry it is my first C4 contest.:hearteyes:


[06/17/2022 1:04 PM] dmitriia
The process is the same for all the contests, it's in the docs on the site.

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[06/17/2022 1:04 PM] illilli000
It's split based on how many high/med findings you have, and how many others have found them: https://docs.code4rena.com/incentive-model-and-awards

{Reactions}
hahaanimado thankyou thankyou 

[06/17/2022 3:45 PM] izhuer
can we have the off-chain logic of validating an order? Or the one for the [test](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-infinity/blob/765376fa238bbccd8b1e2e12897c91098c7e5ac6/helpers/orders.ts#L147) is already good enough?


[06/17/2022 3:45 PM] izhuer
That will help reduce the attack surface of crafting orders


[06/17/2022 4:42 PM] nneverlander
we can put in more logic by calling verify* functions on the contract, checking asset ownership etc


[06/17/2022 4:52 PM] bernd_42
Almost all tests are failing for me. E.g for staker.js, `0 passing (3s) 9 failing` (used `npx hardhat test --grep Staker`)


[06/17/2022 4:54 PM] bernd_42
I've created a `.env` file with following config keys:

```
ETH_GOERLI_PRIV_KEY=
ETH_GOERLI_PRIV_KEY_2=
ETH_MAINNET_PRIV_KEY=
ETH_MAINNET_PRIV_KEY_2=
ALCHEMY_GOERLI_KEY=
ALCHEMY_MAINNET_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
```

(values omitted here)


[06/17/2022 5:44 PM] cryptphi
phew! I was searching all over for function to create buy or sell order too...just came in here to ask same question


[06/17/2022 7:58 PM] nneverlander
what's the error?


[06/17/2022 8:21 PM] bernd_42
This are the failing test results for staker.js

do you have the right folder setup?


[06/17/2022 8:46 PM] bernd_42
Yes, I've cloned the repo and ran the test in the root directory


[06/17/2022 9:18 PM] nneverlander
im not seeing this on my end and no one else reported this


[06/17/2022 9:18 PM] nneverlander
maybe you can DM me and we can figure it out offline?


[06/17/2022 9:19 PM] bernd_42
wtf, just figured it out. I used `yarn` instead of `npm`. I also fixed the package.json versions. Maybe that also fixed it. Anyway, now the tests succeed

{Reactions}
👍🏻 same 

[06/19/2022 5:14 AM] zer0dot
Hey guys just a quick FYI here too


[06/19/2022 5:14 AM] zer0dot
```
    // the below 3 variables are copied to memory once to save on gas
    // an SLOAD costs minimum 100 gas where an MLOAD only costs minimum 3 gas
    // since these values won't change during function execution, we can save on gas by copying them to memory once
    // instead of SLOADing once for each loop iteration
```


[06/19/2022 5:15 AM] zer0dot
This is not actually true, the variables aren't stored in memory by declaring them here, they're just added to the stack!


[06/19/2022 5:40 AM] nneverlander
what about gas savings?


[06/19/2022 10:06 AM] cryptphi
saw this in the contest details, "...Each inflation epoch adds 250M tokens to the supply...." 

please can you clarify who the additional token supply is sent to?


[06/19/2022 10:50 AM] nneverlander
to the contract admin to be used for platform incentives


[06/19/2022 12:41 PM] cryptphi
cool, thanks

when does it move from stack to memory?

if possible, never

[06/20/2022 2:11 AM] zer0dot
unless it's a dynamic type


[06/20/2022 2:11 AM] zer0dot
otherwise, if you're using asm or the IR pipeline, the compiler can move stack variables to memory to avoid a stack overflow

will start going through the findings today and summarize here if it helps (and if it is allowed)
from what I've seen so far, there are just 2 critical bugs that would've resulted in permanent loss of assets by users (one of them related to ERC1155 which we don't support anymore at the contract level and was never supported in our UI and indexers)


[06/20/2022 5:33 AM] nneverlander
cool - the comments were written somewhat hurriedly so they are not 'technically' accurate in all places


[06/20/2022 12:10 PM] izhuer
Just curious, whether the ERC1155 bug will be ranked as high severity, since ERC1155 seems to be in the scope based on the contract code.


[06/20/2022 12:11 PM] nneverlander
hey sure I think its fair to mark it as high severity
